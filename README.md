# NACHO ULTRAFRAGGER 5000

### THE ULTIMATE THROUGH-HOLE MECHANICAL GAMING TKL KEYBOARD. ACTIVE COOLING NOT INCLUDED. ACTIVE GAMING VERY MUCH INCLUDED.

You thought your off-the-shelf keyboard was good enough? You thought wrong. The **Nacho UltraFragger 5000** is a no-compromise, hand-solderable, through-hole-only tenkeyless mechanical keyboard engineered from the ground up for those who demand MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE and ZERO SMD components. Every resistor, every diode, every capacitor — all glorious through-hole, all day long.

Featuring a built-in **USB hub** and a **volume slider** because real fraggers don't alt-tab to change the volume. They twist a knob. Mid-firefight. Without blinking.

## Features

- **100% Through-Hole Construction** — If you can't see the solder joint with your naked eye, we don't want it
- **TKL Layout** — Full-size is for spreadsheets. TKL is for warriors
- **USB Type-C** — Because it's not 2012
- **Integrated USB Hub** — Plug in your mouse, your headset, your backup mouse, whatever
- **Hardware Volume Slider** — Analog control for analog legends
- **ATmega32A Powered** — The reliable workhorse that runs QMK like a champ
- **Fully Open Source** — Schematics, PCB, case files — it's all here, do what you want with it

## Origins

This project is loosely based on the legendary [Mysterium keyboard](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium) by coseyfannitutti — the board that proved you don't need a factory to build a world-class keyboard. We took that foundation, cranked every dial to 11, strapped a USB hub and a volume slider to it, and named it something truly worthy of its power.

## Status

Under active development. Things will break. Things will be re-routed. Capacitors may be added and removed on a whim. This is the way.
